## Hero images

You may include an optional hero image in your posts. Put the images in `public/static/`, and then include in your blog .md file like so:

```
---
title: 'Post title'
author: 'Post author'
date: '2020-04-27'
hero_image: ../static/example.jpg
---
```

See `demo-post-1.md` for an example of this.
